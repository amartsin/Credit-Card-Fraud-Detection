Credit Card fraud detection using Local Outlier Factor Algorithm and Isolation forest Algorithm
Here I tried to  predict the number of frauds using Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest Algorithms . 
The result which I got was ,Isolation Forest Algorithm performed better than the all of the other algorithms .
Data was taken from the Kaggle and inspiration was taken from Krish Naik , fraud detection tutorial.
